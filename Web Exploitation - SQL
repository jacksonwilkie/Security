SQL Injection - Considerations

    Requires Valid SQL Queries
    Fully patched systems can be vulnerable due to misconfiguration
    Input Field Sanitization
    String vs Integer Values
    Is information_schema Database available?
    GET Request versus POST Request HTTP methods

mysql - Shows the database
show databases; - shows databases
use session;
show tables;
select * from session.car; - shows information from the car table
select * from car UNION select tireid,name,size,cost,1,2 from Tires; - shows certain tables from the cars session. (Gives the error SELECT statements have different number of columns)
select * from Tires;
SELECT column, another_column, …

Getting multiple columns -
SELECT Title, Director 
FROM movies;

Selecting a certain row with an Id = 5
SELECT *
from Movies
WHERE Id = 5;

SQL Injection DEMO

show databases;
use session;
show tires;

Stacking Statements
Chaining multiple statements together using a semi-colon ;
SELECT * FROM user WHERE id=‘Johnny'; DROP TABLE Customers;


union select <column> from <database>,<table>

table_scema = list of database names
table_name = kust if tabke banes'
column names = list of column names

INFORMATION_SCHEMA
